%CUSUBSAMPLE Average pooling
%
%   CUSUBSAMPLE(A,B,f) Subsamples every image (columns of A) by a factor
%   of f by computing the average of each non-overlapping f*f
%   neighbourhood and storing the result in B 
%   INPUTS:
%     A : (imgSize * imgSize) x numCases SQUARE images
%     B : (imgSize/f)*(imgSize/f) x numCases SQUARE downsampled images
%     f : factor by which to downsample (in each of x and y) 2<= f <= 16
