CONV,CONV2 MODULES
---------------

- Implemented functions
 * cuConv - wrapper to Alex Krizhevsky's fast 2-D convolution routine:
 convolve every image with every filter
 * cuConv2 - wrapper to Alex Krizhevsky's fast 2-D convolution routine:
 convolve every image with a different set of filters

- Module initialization
 * Run moduleinit from Matlab

COMPILATION
-----------

Include folder '../../utils' in the MATLAB path.

- make cpp 
Compiles all .cpp files

- make cuda
Compiles .cu files into .cubin modules

- make all  
Compiles .cpp and .cu files and copy the compiled files to the release
folder

TESTING
-------

testcuConv.m  - Compares CPU and GPU convolution using cuConv
testcuConv2.m - Compares CPU and GPU convolution using cuConv2
