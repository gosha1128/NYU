MISC MODULE
---------------

- Implemented functions
 * cuRand - uniform random generation
 * cuRandn - Gaussian random generation
 * cuBinarizeProbs - Bernoulli sampling 
 * cuSigmoid - Logistic function
 * cuThreeway - Generalized three-way "outer product"
 * cuDist - Euclidean distance computation
 * cuSquaredDist - Euclidean squared distance computation
 * cuCopyInto - Copies every image into a larger image (zero padding)
 * cuGridToMatrix - like a parallelized im2col
 * cuMatrixToGrid - like a parallelized col2im
 * cuRotate180 - Batch rotation of many filters
 * cuSampleMultinomial - Sample from many same-size multinomial distributions in parallel
 * cuSubsample - Average pooling many images
 * cuSupersample - Upsampling many images by a constant factor
 * cuNCAreg - Compute gradients for NCA regression (like a weighted distance)

- Note: currently the seed file rnd_multipliers_32bit.txt needs to be in the current directory the first time you call any of cuRand,cuRandn,cuBinarizeProbs

- Module initialization
 * Run moduleinit from Matlab

COMPILATION
-----------

Include folder '../../utils' in the MATLAB path.

- make cpp 
Compiles all .cpp files

- make cuda
Compiles .cu files into .cubin modules

- make all  
Compiles .cpp and .cu files and copy the compiled files to the release
folder

TESTING
-------

testAll.m - runs all the individual testXXX functions
