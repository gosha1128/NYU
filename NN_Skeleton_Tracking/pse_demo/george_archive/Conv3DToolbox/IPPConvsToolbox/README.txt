Instructions:

Download and unzip this toolbox in the location of choice. To
setup this toolbox, simply open matlab, cd to this directory, and type "setup"
(without quotes) in the command window. This sets up your path to include the required
directories (you may want to add these paths into your startup.m file as well
however), tries to compile the IPP mex files included in this toolbox,
and opens complete documentation for this toolbox. You can also read the 
setup.m file for some basic documentation about the Toolbox. You will likely have to 
modify the paths in the /MEX/compilemex.m file to suite your machine's setup.
