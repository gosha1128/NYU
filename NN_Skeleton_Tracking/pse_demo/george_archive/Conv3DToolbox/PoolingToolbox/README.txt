Instructions:

Download and unzip this toolbox in the location of choice. To
setup this toolbox, simply open matlab, cd to this directory, and type "setup" 
(without the quotes) in the command window. This sets up your path to include the required
directories (you may want to add these paths into your startup.m file as well
however), compiles the included MEX files (which are MUCH faster than the
included M-files), and opens complete documentation for this toolbox.
